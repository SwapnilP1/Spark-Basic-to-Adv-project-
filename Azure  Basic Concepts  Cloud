Azure Basic Concepts 

Azure is a microsoft cloud computing platfrom offereing a wide
range of servcies to help individuals and organisation build , 
deploy and manage application and services through microsoft - managed data centers 

Azure Components are - : 

1) Azure Resources Manager (ADR)
2) Azure Subscription 
3) Azure Region 
4) Azure Services 
5) Azure CLI and Azure Portal 

1) Azure Resources Manager (ADR) - :  

This is like the control center for managing everything you do in Azure.
It helps you organize and keep track of your various Azure services,
like grouping them together so they're easier to handle.

2) Azure Subscription :- 

Think of this as your personal account for using Azure services.
Just like a subscription to a magazine lets you receive new issues regularly, 
an Azure subscription lets you use and pay for Azure cloud services.

3) Azure Region: :

This is the physical location around the world where Microsoft's 
big data centers are located.When you use Azure services, you can choose which region
hosts your data and applications to reduce delay and meet legal requirements.

4) Azure Services :- 

Azure offers a wide range of services that you can use to build and
run applications in the cloud. This includes services to create virtual computers (to run applications), 
store data, handle databases, and even specific tools for things like artificial intelligence 
or setting up websites.

5) Azure CLI and Azure Portal: 

These are two ways you can interact with Azure:
Azure CLI is a tool for the more tech-savvy users who prefer typing commands to manage Azure services.
Azure Portal is a website where you can click through options to manage Azure services. It's user-friendly,
especially if you prefer a graphical interface over typing commands.

1) Azure Virtual Machines (VMs):

Learn how to create and manage virtual machines in the Azure cloud.
VMs are like computers in the cloud that you can use to run your applications and services.

2) Azure Blob Storage:

Explore Azure's object storage solution for storing large amounts of unstructured data,
such as documents, images, videos, and backups.

3) Azure App Service:
Discover how to build, deploy, and scale web applications and
APIs using Azure's platform-as-a-service (PaaS)offering for web apps.


4) Azure SQL Database: 

Learn about Azure's fully managed relational database service, which allows you to build, manage, and scale SQL databases 
in the cloud without worrying about infrastructure management.

5) Azure Functions: 

Dive into serverless computing with Azure Functions,
which enables you to run small pieces of code (functions)
in response to events without managing infrastructure.

6) Azure Cognitive Services: 

Explore pre-built AI models and APIs for adding intelligent capabilities to your applications,
such as vision, speech, language, and decision-making capabilities.

7) Azure IoT Hub: 

Understand how to connect, monitor, and manage IoT
devices at scale with Azure's managed IoT service.

Tools for data architeure in azure mostly used 

1) Azure Synapse Analytics: 

Azure Synapse Analytics is a cloud-based analytics service that brings together
big data and data warehousing capabilities. It allows you to ingest, prepare, manage, 
and serve data for business intelligence and machine learning applications.

Business Use Case: Suppose you work for a retail company that collects massive amounts of 
sales data from various sources. You can use Azure Synapse Analytics to consolidate this data,
perform advanced analytics, and gain insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and inventory management.


2) Azure Data Factory:Explanation: Azure Data Factory is a cloud-based data integration service that
allows you to create, schedule, and orchestrate data workflows. It enables you to collect
data from multiple sources, transform it, and load it into data stores for analysis and reporting.

 Imagine you work for a healthcare organization that needs to integrate data from electronic
health records (EHR) systems, medical devices, and patient portals. Azure Data Factory
can help you streamline this process, ensuring that healthcare providers
have access to accurate and up-to-date patient information for better decision-making and patient care.

3) Azure Databricks:

Explanation: Azure Databricks is a fast, easy, and collaborative 
Apache Spark-based analytics platform.It provides tools for data engineering, data science, and machine learning, 
allowing teams to collaborate on big data projects.

Let's say you work for a financial services firm that needs to analyze large volumes of financial data
in real-time to detect fraudulent activities. Azure Databricks can help you build and deploy 
machine learning models that identify suspicious transactions and prevent financial fraud.

4) Azure HDInsight:  

Azure HDInsight is a fully managed cloud service that provides Apache Hadoop, Spark, HBase,
and other open-source analytics frameworks. It allows you to process big data workloads using 
familiar open-source tools and languages.

Consider a telecommunications company that wants to analyze call detail records (CDRs) to optimize network performance 
and identify potential issues. Azure HDInsight can help you analyze these large datasets using Apache Hadoop or Spark,
allowing you to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in network traffic.


5) Azure Stream Analytics:

 Azure Stream Analytics is a real-time analytics service that enables you to process and analyze streaming data 
from IoT devices, sensors, social media, and other sources. It provides low-latency processing and actionable insights 
in real-time.

Business Use Case: Suppose you work for an energy utility company that needs to monitor and optimize energy production 
and distribution in real-time. Azure Stream Analytics can analyze streaming data from smart meters, sensors, and weather 
forecasts to predict demand, detect anomalies, and adjust energy production accordingly.
